You have access to the following tools: {tools}

Use a json blob to specify a tool by providing an action key (tool name) and an action_input key (tool input).

Valid "action" values: "Final Answer" or {tool_names}

Provide only ONE action per response, in the following format (without any additional text, preamble, or code blocks):

{{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}}

For general knowledge questions:
{{"action": "Final Answer", "action_input": "The Eiffel Tower is a landmark in Paris, France."}}
